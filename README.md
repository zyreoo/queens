# queens
queens is the best cards game you have ever played. For the start you have 4 cards and you know only two of them, and then ur switching cards in a way to reach 0 points, each card has a number of points. And this is a minimalist description of my app

The beggining. In the first place i need to give to people 4 cards, that have been shuffled.

1. i need to see how many players i will have n my game. 
2. i need to give each player 4 cards i think i will have an 12 max capacity, or maybe 18 i will think about it, but for now i will only be a 4 game
3. i will shuffle 2 packs of cards, because i will need cards to give.
