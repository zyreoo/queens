# queens
this were my thoughts during making of queens

queens is the best cards game you have ever played. For the start you have 4 cards and you know only two of them, and then ur switching cards in a way to reach 0 points, each card has a number of points. And this is a minimalist description of my app

The beggining. In the first place i need to give to people 4 cards, that have been shuffled.

1. i need to see how many players i will have n my game. 
2. i need to give each player 4 cards i think i will have an 12 max capacity, or maybe 18 i will think about it, but for now i will only be a 4 game 
3. i will shuffle 2 packs of cards, because i will need cards to give. 

Now i have solved the problem of the shown cards, and the cards are not showen in the first place of the game


middle game 

each player has a deck of cards and knows two cards, now  he takes a card from the remaining deck
now i need to see if the a player has the same card with the table one to ask him if he wants to put it down - solved
i need to make the player if it gives a card down to remain with -1 
now i need to make the rules of the cards: 
-if you put j on a table you can make an exchange for cards
-if you put K down you can choose to see one of ur cards
-if it puts a Q down to can go to the next person 

end game
-first i need to ask them if they want to queens, they got blocked and the round will go until the previous round and then will which is the player with the lowest points
- i ve made the end game i made the last two exceptions to win the people with the lowest point and the last rule if the player who said queens hasnt the lowest point score to take the all score from everyone
- i added when the deck is empy to use the used deck
